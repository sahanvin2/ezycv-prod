# 10 Power Verbs That Make Your CV Stand Out

Words are powerful. The verbs you choose on your CV signal confidence, leadership, and results. Weak, passive language tells a recruiter you were present. Strong action verbs tell them you made a difference.

Here's a list of the 10 most impactful power verbs — and how to use them correctly.

## Why Verbs Matter

Compare these two bullet points:

- ❌ "Was responsible for managing a team of 5 developers"
- ✅ "Led a cross-functional team of 5 developers to deliver a £400K product upgrade on time and under budget"

Same experience. Completely different impact. The verb sets the tone for everything that follows.

## Words to Replace Right Now

| Replace this ❌ | With this ✅ |

| Responsible for | Led / Managed / Owned |
| Helped with | Contributed to / Supported |
| Did / Worked on | Executed / Delivered / Built |
| In charge of | Directed / Oversaw / Administered |
| Tried to | Achieved / Accomplished |

## Pro Tip: The STAR Formula

For each bullet point, use the **STAR structure** to make your achievements shine:

- **S**ituation — brief context (optional, keep it short)
- **T**ask — what needed to be done
- **A**ction — what you did (start with a power verb)
- **R**esult — the outcome, with numbers where possible

> "Following a drop in customer retention, **led** a root-cause analysis and redesigned the onboarding experience, **reducing** churn by 22% within two quarters."
