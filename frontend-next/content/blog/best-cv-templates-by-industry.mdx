# The Best CV Templates for Every Industry in 2025

Not all CV templates are created equal. A creative design firm expects something very different from a financial institution. Using the wrong template in the wrong industry can send the wrong message — even if your experience is perfect.

Here's our industry-by-industry breakdown of the best CV styles to use.

## 🏦 Finance & Banking: Classic or Professional

In finance, **conservatism signals trustworthiness**. Stick to:
- Black and white or navy/dark blue colour schemes
- Traditional serif or clean sans-serif fonts
- No photos (in most Western markets)
- Clear, logical structure

**Best EzyCV templates:** Classic, Executive, Professional

## 💻 Technology & Software Development

Tech roles value clarity and efficiency — just like good code. The best tech CVs:
- Lead with a strong technical skills section
- Include links to GitHub and portfolio projects
- Use clean, minimal formatting
- Highlight impact with metrics ("Reduced API response time by 40%")

**Best EzyCV templates:** Tech, Minimal, Modern

## 🎨 Creative Industries (Design, Marketing, Media)

Creative CVs *can* be more visually expressive — but don't let style eclipse substance. The best approach:
- Use a subtle accent colour
- Include a portfolio link (essential)
- Add a brief personal statement that shows your creative voice
- Keep it clean — let your portfolio do the heavy lifting

**Best EzyCV templates:** Creative, Modern, Elegant

## 🏥 Healthcare & Medicine

Medical CVs (or clinical CVs/portfolios) tend to be longer than standard CVs and include publications, training, and certifications. For other healthcare roles:
- Emphasise certifications and licenses
- Be thorough about clinical experience
- Keep formatting professional and easy to scan

**Best EzyCV templates:** Professional, Classic, Academic

## 📚 Academia & Research

Academic CVs are often much longer than standard CVs and include publications, conferences, grants, and teaching experience. Focus on:
- Publications (listed in full academic citation format)
- Research interests
- Teaching experience
- Conference presentations

**Best EzyCV templates:** Academic, Classic

## 🛒 Sales & Business Development

Sales CVs live and die by numbers. Make your metrics impossible to miss:
- "Achieved 135% of quota for 3 consecutive quarters"
- "Grew client base from 50 to 200 accounts in 18 months"
- "Closed £2.3M in new business in FY2024"

**Best EzyCV templates:** Professional, Modern, Executive

## 🎓 Recent Graduates

As a graduate with limited experience, your CV needs to make the most of:
- Academic projects and dissertations
- Internships and part-time work
- Extracurricular activities and leadership roles
- Transferable skills

**Best EzyCV templates:** Compact, Modern, Minimal

## The Universal Rules

Whatever your industry, these rules always apply:

1. **One to two pages maximum** (exception: academia)
2. **Tailor for each application** — no generic CVs
3. **Achievements, not duties** — show impact
4. **Proofread three times** — then ask someone else to proofread
