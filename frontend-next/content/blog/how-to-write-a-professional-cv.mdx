# How to Write a Professional CV in 2025

Creating a professional CV is one of the most important steps in your job search journey. In 2025, recruiters spend an average of just **7 seconds** scanning a CV before deciding whether to read further. Here's how to make every second count.

## 1. Start with a Strong Personal Statement

Your personal statement (or professional summary) is the first thing recruiters read. Keep it concise — 2 to 3 sentences that highlight your experience, key skills, and career goals.

**Example:**
> Results-driven software engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable web applications. Proficient in React, Node.js, and cloud infrastructure. Seeking to leverage my expertise in a fast-paced startup environment.

## 2. Tailor Your CV to Each Job

One-size-fits-all CVs are a thing of the past. Study the job description carefully and mirror the language and requirements in your CV. Use keywords from the posting — many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that scan for specific terms.

## 3. Focus on Achievements, Not Duties

Instead of listing what you were responsible for, highlight what you **achieved**. Use numbers and metrics wherever possible.

- ❌ "Responsible for managing social media accounts"
- ✅ "Grew social media engagement by 150% in 6 months, resulting in 2,000+ new followers"

## 4. Keep the Design Clean and Professional

A cluttered CV is hard to read. Use:
- **Clear section headings** — Education, Experience, Skills, etc.
- **Consistent formatting** — same font, spacing, and bullet style throughout
- **White space** — don't cram everything together

With EzyCV's templates, you get professionally designed layouts that are ATS-friendly and visually appealing.

## 5. Include the Right Sections

A strong CV typically includes:
1. **Contact Information** — Name, email, phone, LinkedIn, portfolio
2. **Professional Summary** — 2-3 sentence overview
3. **Work Experience** — Reverse chronological order
4. **Education** — Degrees, certifications, relevant coursework
5. **Skills** — Technical and soft skills
6. **Additional Sections** — Projects, volunteer work, languages

## 6. Proofread Everything

Typos and grammatical errors can cost you an interview. Read your CV aloud, use spell-check tools, and ask a friend to review it before submitting.
