# How to Write a Cover Letter That Actually Gets Read

A compelling cover letter is one of the most underrated tools in your job search arsenal. While many candidates treat it as an afterthought, a well-written cover letter can be the deciding factor between landing an interview and being passed over.

## The Structure That Works

Before you write a single word, understand what hiring managers actually want: **brevity, relevance, and personality**.

### The Opening: Hook Them in the First Line

Skip the tired "I am writing to apply for…" opening. Instead, lead with something memorable:

> "After scaling three early-stage startups as Head of Growth, I know exactly what it takes to hit aggressive targets — and your Series A announcement tells me that's exactly what you need right now."

This immediately shows you've done your research and positions you as a problem-solver.

### The Body: Connect Your Experience to Their Needs

Use two short paragraphs:

1. **Paragraph 1** – Your most relevant achievement, quantified. Show you can deliver results.
2. **Paragraph 2** – Why *this* company specifically. Reference their product, culture, or recent news. This proves you're not mass-applying.

### The Close: Make the Next Step Easy

End with a clear call to action:

> "I'd love 20 minutes to discuss how my background in [X] aligns with your goals for [Y]. I'm available this week — feel free to reply or book time directly: [link]."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Repeating your CV** — the cover letter should complement, not duplicate your CV
- ❌ **"I believe I would be a great fit"** — show, don't tell
- ❌ **More than one page** — if you can't sell yourself in 3–4 paragraphs, something's wrong
- ❌ **Generic openers** — "To Whom It May Concern" is an instant red flag in 2025

## A Template to Get You Started

```
Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

[Hook — 1–2 sentences that grab attention and show research]

[Achievement paragraph — What you've done, with a specific metric]

[Connection paragraph — Why this company, this role, this moment]

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to [Company]. I'm available at your convenience.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
```
