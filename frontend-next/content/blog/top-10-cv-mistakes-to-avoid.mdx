# Top 10 CV Mistakes to Avoid in 2025

Even highly qualified candidates can miss out on interviews because of simple CV mistakes. Here are the top 10 errors to avoid — and how to fix them.

## 1. Using a Generic CV for Every Application

Sending the same CV to every job is one of the biggest mistakes you can make. Each application should be tailored to match the specific role and company.

**Fix:** Customize your professional summary and skills section for each application. Mirror keywords from the job description.

## 2. Including an Unprofessional Email Address

Your email is one of the first things recruiters notice. Addresses like `cooldude99@email.com` won't make a great impression.

**Fix:** Use a professional email format: `firstname.lastname@email.com`

## 3. Writing Too Much (or Too Little)

A CV that's five pages long is just as problematic as one that's half a page. Recruiters prefer concise, relevant information.

**Fix:** Aim for 1–2 pages. Include only experience and skills relevant to the role you're applying for.

## 4. Listing Duties Instead of Achievements

Recruiters want to know what impact you made, not just what your job description said.

**Fix:** Start bullet points with action verbs and include measurable results: "Increased sales by 30% through targeted marketing campaigns."

## 5. Poor Formatting and Layout

Inconsistent fonts, cramped text, and lack of white space make a CV hard to read.

**Fix:** Use a clean, professional template. EzyCV's templates are designed for readability and ATS compatibility.

## 6. Including Irrelevant Personal Information

Your marital status, religion, or date of birth are unnecessary in most countries and can lead to unconscious bias.

**Fix:** Stick to professional information: name, email, phone number, LinkedIn, and portfolio URL.

## 7. Forgetting to Include Keywords

Many companies use ATS software that filters CVs based on keywords. If your CV doesn't contain the right terms, it may never reach a human.

**Fix:** Carefully read the job posting and include relevant keywords naturally throughout your CV.

## 8. Using Outdated Information

Including a job from 15 years ago or listing skills in technologies no one uses anymore can make you seem out of touch.

**Fix:** Focus on the last 10–15 years of experience. Keep your skills section current.

## 9. Not Proofreading

Spelling and grammar errors suggest a lack of attention to detail — a red flag for any employer.

**Fix:** Use spell-check tools, read your CV aloud, and have someone else review it before submitting.

## 10. Missing Contact Information

It sounds obvious, but some candidates forget to include a phone number or use an outdated email.

**Fix:** Double-check that your contact details are current and prominent at the top of your CV.
