# ATS-Proof Your CV: How to Beat the Robots in 2025

Here's a sobering statistic: **75% of CVs are rejected before a human ever sees them**. They're filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) — software used by over 95% of Fortune 500 companies.

The good news? Once you understand how ATS works, it's easy to beat.

## What is an ATS?

An ATS is software that automatically scans, parses, and ranks CVs based on how well they match a job description. It looks for keywords, formatting patterns, and relevant experience before routing the best-matching CVs to a recruiter.

If your CV doesn't pass the ATS, **no human will ever read it** — no matter how qualified you are.

## 7 Rules for an ATS-Proof CV

### 1. Use Keywords from the Job Description

This is the most important rule. Read the job posting carefully and identify the key skills, tools, and phrases they use. Then use those exact words in your CV.

**Example:** If the posting says "project management experience with Agile methodologies," don't write "worked on sprints." Write "project management using Agile methodologies."

### 2. Stick to Standard Section Headings

ATS systems are trained to look for standard headings. Use:
- **Work Experience** (not "Career History" or "Where I've Worked")
- **Education** (not "Academic Background")
- **Skills** (not "What I Bring to the Table")

### 3. Avoid Tables, Text Boxes, and Columns

ATS software often reads documents left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Two-column layouts, fancy tables, and text boxes can confuse the parser and cause critical information to be skipped.

### 4. Use a Clean, Simple Font

Stick to standard fonts: **Arial, Calibri, Georgia, or Times New Roman**. Decorative fonts may not render correctly when parsed by ATS.

### 5. Submit as .docx or PDF (When Specified)

Some ATS platforms struggle with PDFs. Check the job listing — if it doesn't specify, send both a PDF for visual presentation and keep a .docx version ready.

### 6. Include a Skills Section

Create a dedicated skills section that lists both hard and soft skills. Many ATS systems scan specifically for this section.

### 7. Spell Out Abbreviations (At Least Once)

Write "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)" the first time you mention it. Some ATS systems don't recognize abbreviations alone.

## What to Include vs. What to Leave Out

| Include ✅ | Leave Out ❌ |
|---|---|
| Exact keywords from the job posting | Headers/footers (often ignored by ATS) |
| Quantifiable achievements | Photos or graphics |
| Standard section headings | Tables and text boxes |
| Complete contact information | Fancy fonts and icons |

## Quick ATS Checklist

- [ ] Used keywords from the job description throughout?
- [ ] Standard section headings in use?
- [ ] Single-column layout (no tables/columns)?
- [ ] Clean, standard font?
- [ ] Saved in the requested file format?
- [ ] Spelled out all abbreviations at first use?
