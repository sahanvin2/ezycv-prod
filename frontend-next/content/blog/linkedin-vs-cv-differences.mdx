# LinkedIn Profile vs. CV: Key Differences and Why You Need Both

In 2025, having a strong LinkedIn profile *and* a polished CV isn't optional — it's expected. But many job seekers treat them as interchangeable. They're not. Each serves a distinct purpose, and using them strategically can dramatically improve your job search results.

## The Core Difference

| | **CV** | **LinkedIn Profile** |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Apply for a specific role | Get discovered by recruiters |
| **Tone** | Formal, concise | More conversational, personal |
| **Length** | 1–2 pages | No hard limit |
| **Audience** | Hiring manager | Recruiters + professional network |
| **Updates** | Updated per application | Always evolving |
| **Visuals** | Minimal | Profile photo, banner |

## Your CV: Precision Tool for Specific Applications

Your CV should be **tailored for each job application**. It's a targeted document that answers one question: "Why should I hire you for *this specific role*?"

Key CV principles:
- Start from scratch for each application (or at least adjust summary and skills)
- Include exactly the keywords from the job description
- Quantify every achievement possible
- Keep it to 1–2 pages — recruiters spend 7 seconds scanning it initially

## Your LinkedIn: Your Always-On Personal Brand

LinkedIn is a **passive job search tool**. Even when you're not actively applying, recruiters are searching LinkedIn for candidates. Your profile needs to work for you 24/7.

Key LinkedIn principles:
- Use a professional headshot (profiles with photos get **21x more views**)
- Write a headline that goes beyond your job title (e.g., "Front-End Developer | React & TypeScript | Building fast, accessible web experiences")
- Your "About" section is where you have a *voice* — use it
- Get recommendations from managers and colleagues
- Engage with content in your field — it signals you're active

## 5 Ways to Sync Your CV and LinkedIn

1. **Keep core facts consistent** — dates, titles, and company names must match
2. **LinkedIn can expand** — include projects, volunteer work, and side projects your CV doesn't have room for
3. **Skills endorsements matter** — ensure your LinkedIn skills align with your CV skills
4. **Include your LinkedIn URL on your CV** — make it easy for recruiters to learn more
5. **Customise your LinkedIn URL** — set it to `linkedin.com/in/firstname-lastname` for a professional look

## The Strategy: Use Both Together

- **Proactive job search** → Lead with a tailored CV
- **Passive search / being found** → Keep LinkedIn optimised year-round
- **During the interview process** → Recruiters *will* check your LinkedIn, so keep it consistent with your CV
